Title: Everyone is something in LKO
Text: Born and raised in Delhi - I shifted to LKO in Dec 24 for business purposes. I have hardly seen a car which does not have a sticker on it - everyone is uttar pradesh sarkar, adhiwakta, nyay palika, mahamantri, skoda laura, adrak lsson. 


What is the obsession peeps.

Comment: Scam.

Comment: Malls are a thing of past - and entire LKO is on steroids in rents cost, despite low to no demand.

Comment: I was caught without helmet and license (close to my home). Cops outright wanted to fine me, but a 'common guy' came in and discussed bribe on my behalf with cops. I gave him 200rs (back in 2011) and Cops let me go.

He was not a common man. He was their agent and shield. If I or anyone recorded myself handing out money, it would be to a common man, not cops directly.

Comment: Cops keep a civ around to discuss bribes.

Comment: Toh hum Noida or Ghaziabad se pahadio ko bhagana shuru karein fir? ðŸ˜‚ Bhukmari ajaegi

Comment: A menu easy to cook/process - healthy and quick.

Comment: Haha Delhi is hateable too but mostly those are HR or UP14 NCR vehicle. Plus the percentage of vehicles of such sort is low.

Comment: Its about the volume/%. The number of cars having these stickers is way too high compared to Delhi, or anywhere else.

Comment: Never seen anything of this sort in capital city of India. So yes I did not expect ðŸ¤ª

Comment: Dont you have big muscle brothers or friends? or cop/lawyer friends? My hands are always itching to teach a lesson to such people.
